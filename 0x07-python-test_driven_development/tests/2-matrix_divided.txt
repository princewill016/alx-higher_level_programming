The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
---------------------

Import module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Test normal matrix division:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Test matrix with floats:
    >>> matrix = [[1.1, -2.2, 3.3], [4.4, 5.5, -6.6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.55, -1.1, 1.65], [2.2, 2.75, -3.3]]

Test division by negative number:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -3))
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Test empty matrix:
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test matrix with uneven rows:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Test division by zero:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    ... except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    division by zero

Test non-number division:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, "three"))
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    div must be a number

Test matrix with non-numbers:
    >>> matrix = [[1, "two", 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test matrix with None:
    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_divided(None, 3))
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(str(e))
    matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test division by float('inf'):
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, float('inf')))
    [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
